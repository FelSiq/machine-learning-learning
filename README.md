# machine-learning-learning
This is a repository about learning machine learning.

This repository is supposed to compile some of my machine learning related activities. Here, I will put some experiments and some model implementation codes. One shouldn't expect high performance neither robustness using these implementations, as optimized and fault tolerant models aren't and shouldn't be the real target here.
