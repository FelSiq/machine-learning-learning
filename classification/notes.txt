False Negative - Type II : predizer que não aconteceria algo que aconteceu
False Positive - Type  I : predizer que aconteceria algo que não aconteceu

Accuracy: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FN + FP)
Error Rate: (FP + FN) / (TP + TN + FN + FP)

Error Rate: 1 - Accuracy

Accurary Paradox: 
Seu modelo não tem uma Accuracy aceitável somemte por estar próximo de 1. Sua acurácia passa
a ser aceitável apenas no momento que a mesma supera a acurácia de predizer tudo numa mesma classe.
Ex.: Suponha a seguinte matrix de confusão:

50 20	acurácia: (50 + 10)/ (50 + 10 + 20 + 5) = 0.7058824
5  10	Err Rate: 1 - acurácia = 0.2941176

Agora, suponha que predizemos sempre para a classe 1, isto é, a matrix de confusão ficaria da seguinte maneira:

70 0	acurácia: (70 + 0)/(70 + 15 + 0 + 0) = 0.8235294 (subiu)
15 0	Err rate: 1 - acurácia = 0.1764706 (desceu)

CAP: Comulative Accuracy Profile
ROC: Receiver Operating Characteristic

AR = Area entre a CAP perfeita e a CAP do modelo / Area entre a CAP do model e a linha de sampling aleatório

Notes: ==============================

2. How do I know which model to choose for my problem ?

Same as for regression models, you first need to figure out whether your problem is linear or non linear. You will learn how to do that in Part 10 - Model Selection. Then:

If your problem is linear, you should go for Logistic Regression or SVM.

If your problem is non linear, you should go for K-NN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree or Random Forest.

Then which one should you choose in each case ? You will learn that in Part 10 - Model Selection with k-Fold Cross Validation.

Then from a business point of view, you would rather use:

- Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes when you want to rank your predictions by their probability. For example if you want to rank your customers from the highest probability that they buy a certain product, to the lowest probability. Eventually that allows you to target your marketing campaigns. And of course for this type of business problem, you should use Logistic Regression if your problem is linear, and Naive Bayes if your problem is non linear.

- SVM when you want to predict to which segment your customers belong to. Segments can be any kind of segments, for example some market segments you identified earlier with clustering.

- Decision Tree when you want to have clear interpretation of your model results,

- Random Forest when you are just looking for high performance with less need for interpretation.
